# SKILL SHARPENING PYTHON Part 1

This repo allows you to practice the basics of Python in the same manner in which you practiced the basics of JS in Mod 1. Albeit tedious, it is good to understand the basics before you jump to more difficult concepts. This allows you to become a stronger developer. Good Luck!
