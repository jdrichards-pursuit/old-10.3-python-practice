## Test Your Knowledge

<img src = './assets/sharpening.webp' alt = 'sharpening' width = '50%'/>

This repo allows you to practice the basics of Python that you have just learned. Albeit tedious, it is good to understand the basics before you jump to more difficult concepts. This allows you to become a stronger developer. 

### Complete the following exercises to test your knowledge of what you've just learned.
When necessary, use the [Lesson](https://github.com/jdrichards-pursuit/week-3.2-python-theory/blob/main/lesson.ipynb) as a reference.



Before you start, make sure you create your virtual environment.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Choose 'yes' when prompted to include the `venv` in your workspace.

Remember to choose `Install` when prompted to install the `ipykernel` package.

Now you can choose each set of exercises from the sidebar based on the concepts you want to practice.

Good luck!
